<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<h4>Neural network classification</h4>

<p class="i1">
    The Idepix classification algorithm for Sentinel-3 OLCI is based on a neural network approach. A common neural net
    is used for both land and water pixels.
    As input for the neural net, the square roots of the OLCI TOA reflectances (obtained from an internal
    radiance-to-reflectance conversion) in all 21 bands are used. <br> <br>

    As output, the neural net finally provides per pixel one of the properties 'cloud sure',
    'cloud ambiguous', 'cloud' (which means sure OR ambiguous) ,  or 'snow/ice'.

<h4>Additional properties</h4>
<p class="i1">
    The following additional pixel properties are provided from the classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        'cloud_buffer': For pixels identified as cloudy, a cloud buffer of specified width can be set by the user to finally obtain a more
        conservative cloud mask. This is done in a post-processing step after the cloud classification has been applied
        on the full image. The cloud buffer algorithm works on pixel wondows of size (2N+1) x (2N+1) with N = cloud buffer
        width. Note that the cloud buffer is only applied on cloud-free pixels, i.e. cloudy pixels are not flagged as cloud
        buffer of cloudy neighbour pixels.
        The cloud buffer procedure is described in a bit more detail in the CCI Land Cover ATBD [1].
    </li>
    <li>
        'land': the pixel is located over land
    </li>
    <li>
        'coastline': the pixel is a coastline pixel
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="i1">
By default, the 'land' and 'coastline' pixels are identified from the land flag included in the
quality flags which come with the L1b product. Optionally, the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) land/water
mask[2] can be applied instead.
The latter is a fractional mask:
<ul>
    <li>
        water fraction = 0 : 'land'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction &gt; 0 and  water fraction  &lt; 100: 'coastline'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction = 100: 'water'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Final classification flags</h4>
<p>
    In summary, from the algorithm steps outlined above, the following final classification flags are provided for
    Sentinel-3 OLCI:
<ul>
    <li>
        'INVALID' (input invalid or no classification possible)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD' (which means either CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS or CLOUD_SURE)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SURE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_BUFFER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'SNOW_ICE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'COASTLINE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'LAND'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional bands</h4>
<p class="i1">
    Thee are additional bands provided which are computed as follows:
<ul>
    <li>
        'surface_pressure': <br>
        &emsp; p = 1013.25 * exp(-altitude/H) with the altitude given in metres, and the scale height H = 8400m
    </li>
    <li>
        'cloud_over_snow': <br>
        &emsp; 1.0 &emsp; if pixel_classif_flags.IDEPIX_LAND && Oa21_reflectance > 0.5 && surface_13 - trans_13 < 0.01 <br>
        &emsp; 0.0 &emsp; otherwise
    </li>
    <li>
        'coastline': the pixel is a coastline pixel
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>
    The following pixel properties are currently NOT provided for OLCI:
<ul>
    <li>
        'BRIGHT'
    </li>
    <li>
        'WHITE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SHADOW'
    </li>
    <li>
        'MIXED_PIXEL'
    </li>
</ul>
