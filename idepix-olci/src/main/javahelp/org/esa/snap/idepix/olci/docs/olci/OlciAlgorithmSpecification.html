<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<h4>Neural network classification</h4>

<p>
    The IdePix classification algorithm for Sentinel-3 OLCI is based on a neural network approach. A common neural net
    is used for both land and water pixels.
    As input for the neural net, the square roots of the OLCI TOA reflectances (obtained from an internal
    radiance-to-reflectance conversion) in all 21 bands are used. <br> <br>

    As output, the neural net finally provides per pixel one of the properties 'cloud sure',
    'cloud ambiguous', 'cloud' (which means sure OR ambiguous) ,  or 'snow/ice'.<br>

    Over land the 'snow/ice' flag is refined by spatial and spectral tests to provide a better separation between cloud
    and snow.

<h4>Additional properties</h4>
<p>
    The following additional pixel properties are provided from the classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        'cloud_buffer': For pixels identified as cloudy, a cloud buffer of specified width can be set by the user to finally obtain a more
        conservative cloud mask. This is done in a post-processing step after the cloud classification has been applied
        on the full image. The cloud buffer algorithm works on pixel windows of size (2N+1) x (2N+1) with N = cloud buffer
        width. Note that the cloud buffer is only applied on cloud-free pixels, i.e. cloudy pixels are not flagged as cloud
        buffer of cloudy neighbour pixels.
        The cloud buffer procedure is described in a bit more detail in the CCI Land Cover ATBD [1].
    </li>
    <li>
        'bright': the pixel is a bright pixel. The information is retained from the quality flags of the L1b product.
    </li>
    <li>
        'land': the pixel is located over land
    </li>
    <li>
        'coastline': the pixel is a coastline pixel
    </li>
</ul>

By default, the 'land' and 'coastline' pixels are identified from the land flag included in the
quality flags which come with the L1b product. Optionally, the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) land/water
mask[2] can be applied instead.
The latter is a fractional mask:
<ul>
    <li>
        water fraction = 0 : 'land'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction &gt; 0 and  water fraction  &lt; 100: 'coastline'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction = 100: 'water'
    </li>
</ul>

Two shadow flags are provided with the classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        'cloud_shadow': the cloud top height is estimated from the O2 absorption bands with a dedicated neural network.
        Starting from each cloud free pixel, the pixels along the (projected) path towards the sun are checked. If they are
        flagged as 'cloud' and the cloud top height exceeds the elevation of the search path above ground, this cloud is
        likely to cast a shadow at the start point. The minimum elevation is fixed at 300m above ground. If a cloudy pixel is
        found within the search path, the 'cloud_shadow' flag is raised at the start pixel and the search is aborted. Otherwise,
        the algorithm carries on until the maximum length of the search path is reached, which is defined by a theoretical maximum
        cloud top height at current latitude. The cloud shadow algorithm is applied as part of the postprocessing of the
        classification.
    </li>
    <li>
        'mountain_shadow': a hillshade algorithm [3] is implemented, which derives slopes from elevation data and uses a
        geometric test with slope, aspect and illumination and satellite observation conditions against a threshold to
        find pixel in the (core) shadow of mountainous terrain.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Final classification flags</h4>
<p>
    In summary, from the algorithm steps outlined above, the following final classification flags are provided for
    Sentinel-3 OLCI:
<ul>
    <li>
        'INVALID' (input invalid or no classification possible)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD' (which means either CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS or CLOUD_SURE)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SURE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_BUFFER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SHADOW'
    </li>
    <li>
        'SNOW_ICE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'BRIGHT'
    </li>
    <li>
        'COASTLINE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'LAND'
    </li>
    <li>
        'MOUNTAIN_SHADOW'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>
    The mountain shadow algorithm can show an artefact at the nadir line, where viewing angles are not exact enough.
    The following pixel property is currently NOT provided for Sentinel-3 OLCI:
<ul>
    <li>
        'WHITE'
    </li>
</ul>
