<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    Used to select the IdePix OLCI source product. Use the <b>...</b> buttons to
    open a data product currently not opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
</p>

<h5>Supported IdePix OLCI L1b Source Products</h5>
<p class="i1">
The following source products are supported for Idepix classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        S3A_OL_1_EFR_*.SEN3:<br>
        Full Resolution TOA Radiance, after radiometrical and spectral calibration
    </li>
    <li>
        S3A_OL_1_ERR_*.SEN3:<br>
        Reduced Resolution TOA Radiance, after radiometrical and spectral calibration
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="i1">
For detailed product descriptions and file naming conventions see the Sentinel-3 OLCI L1b Product User Guide
(https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci/product-types/level-1b).

<h5>Supported optional source products</h5>
<p class="i1">
The following optional source products are supported for Idepix classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        DEM product for O2 correction:<br>
        A product which has an input format supported by SNAP and which contains a DEM altitude band to
        be used in the O2 correction called by IdePix as an alternative to the altitude band provided
        with the OLCI L1b product.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="i1">
For more details on the O2 correction see the help documentation of the corresponding SNAP plugin which had
to be installed together with this IdePix plugin.

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

<h3>The Processing Parameters</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/OlciParameters.png"></p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name of DEM band (if optional DEM product is provided): </b><br>
    The name of the altitude band in the optional DEM product. Mandatory if a DEM product is provided.
    If no DEM product is provided, this parameter has no effect.
</p>

<h3>The Processing Result</h3>

<p>
    The IdePix OLCI processor for S3-Snow provides the following outputs:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/processor_output.png"></p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Oa21_reflectance: </b><br>
    TOA reflectance for band 21 (1020nm).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>trans_13: </b><br>
    The rectified and desmiled transmission for band 13 (761.25nm).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>press_13: </b><br>
    The pressure for band 13 for a given rectified transmission, which would be measured in given band
    without scattering. Useful for a first object height estimation for bright targets.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>surface_13: </b><br>
    The rectified transmission for band 13, which would be measured without scattering ('surface transmission').
    Useful only for comparison purposes.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>surface_pressure: </b><br>
    The pressure at altitude of the surface.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>cloud_over_snow: </b><br>
    Mask band indicating if there is cloud over snow (value 1.0) for the given pixel, 0.0 otherwise.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>pixel_classif_flags: </b><br>
    Standard IdePix classification flag band (see below).
</p>
<br>


<p class="i1">
The Idepix classification result is written into the target product as a flag band named 'pixel_classif_flags'.
This band holds integer values which for Sentinel-3 OLCI follow the flag coding shown below.

<p align="center">

</p>
<br>

<p class="i1">
The target product also provides a corresponding flag mask to visualize the pixel classification through the
SNAP Mask Manager:
