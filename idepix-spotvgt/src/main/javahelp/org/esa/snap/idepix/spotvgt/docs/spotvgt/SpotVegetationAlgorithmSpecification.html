<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<h4>Neural network classification</h4>

<p>
    The Idepix classification algorithm for SPOT Vegetation is based on a combination of a neural network approach
    and a 'feature extraction and classification' scheme which was originally developed in the frame of the
    ESA DUE GlobAlbedo project. It is described in detail in the project ATBD [1].
    A common neural net
    is used for both land and water pixels.
    As input for the neural net, the square roots of the SPOT Vegetation TOA reflectances in the 4 bands
    at 450nm, 645nm, 835nm and 1670nm are used.  <br> <br>

    As output, the neural net finally provides per pixel one of the properties 'cloud sure',
    'cloud ambiguous', 'cloud' (which means sure OR ambiguous) ,  or 'snow/ice'.

<h4>Additional properties</h4>
<p>
    The following additional pixel properties are provided from the classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        'cloud_buffer': For pixels identified as cloudy, a cloud buffer of specified width can be set by the user to finally obtain a more
        conservative cloud mask. This is done in a post-processing step after the cloud classification has been applied
        on the full image. The cloud buffer algorithm works on pixel windows of size (2N+1) x (2N+1) with N = cloud buffer
        width. Note that the cloud buffer is only applied on cloud-free pixels, i.e. cloudy pixels are not flagged as cloud
        buffer of cloudy neighbour pixels.
        The cloud buffer procedure is described in a bit more detail in the CCI Land Cover ATBD [2].
    </li>
    <li>
        'bright':
        The brightness classification is obtained from the 'feature extraction and classification' scheme.
        A bright spectrum means that the intensity of the spectral curve (related to the albedo) should present relatively
        high values. Therefore, cloud brightness is calculated for each pixel as the integral of spectrum, and differs from
        the average of the spectral channels since it takes into account the distribution of the energy along the spectrum.
    </li>
    <li>
        'white':
        The whiteness classification is obtained from the 'feature extraction and classification' scheme.
        A white spectrum means that the spectral signature must be flat along the spectrum. The first derivative of the
        spectral curve should present low values, but noise and calibration errors may reduce the accuracy in the estimation
        of the spectrum flatness when computing the spectral derivative in channels with similar wavelengths.
    </li>
    <li>
        'land': the pixel is located over land
    </li>
    <li>
        'water': the pixel is located over water
    </li>
    <li>
        'clear land': the pixel is clear and located over land. Here, the identification as 'clear' is obtained
        from a radiometric test within the feature extraction approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        'clear water': the pixel is clear and located over water. Here, the identification as 'clear' is obtained
        from a radiometric test within the feature extraction approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        'coastline': the pixel is a coastline pixel
    </li>
</ul>

The 'land' and 'coastline' pixels are identified from an SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) land/water mask [3].
This is a fractional mask:
<ul>
    <li>
        water fraction = 0 : 'land'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction &gt; 0 and  water fraction  &lt; 100: 'coastline'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction = 100: 'water'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Final classification flags</h4>
<p>
    In summary, from the algorithm steps outlined above, the following final classification flags are provided for
    SPOT Vegetation:
<ul>
    <li>
        'INVALID' (input invalid or no classification possible)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD' (which means either CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS or CLOUD_SURE)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SURE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_BUFFER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SHADOW'
    </li>
    <li>
        'SNOW_ICE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'COASTLINE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'LAND'
    </li>
    <li>
        'WATER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLEAR_LAND'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLEAR_WATER'
    </li>
</ul>
