<h3>Algorithm Description</h3>
<h4>North Direction</h4>
<p>As all calculations of the shadow are translated to the geometry of the pixel grid, it is necessary to calculate the
    north direction (also called orientation or bearing) for each pixel individually.
    The orientation for a pixel (i,j) is derived from the neighboring pixel (i, j-1) and (i, j+1) from pixel-geocoded
    location:</p>
<p><img src="images/eq001_orientation.png"></p>
<h4>Defining a cloud mask</h4>
The following cloud flags have been combined in a cloud mask: <br>
Cloud_in.visible (bit 0), cloud_in.gross_cloud (bit 7), cloud_in.thin_cirrus (bit 8) and the cloud_in.medium_high (bit
9).
<h4>Adjustment of Sun Zenith Angle for Elevated Objects</h4>
Under tilted view (view zenith angle > 0°) elevated objects of unknown height like clouds are projected along the line
of view on the surface, so that their apparent location differs from the actual position over ground (nadir view).
If view and sun azimuth angle are positioned in the same halfspace, both left or right of the nadir line (center line of
grid) in the projected grid, <code>x_tx>0 (VAA<sup>*</sup>180°)</code>, <code>SAA<sup>*</sup>>180°</code> or <code>x_tx<0
    (VAA<sup>*</sup><180°)</code>,
<code>SAA*<180°</code> (angles are corrected by
orientation), the geometry of the apparent sun zenith angle which causes the shadow position can be described in the
following way:
From
<p><img src="images/eq002_apparentSza_1.png"></p>
follows
<p><img src="images/eq002_apparentSza_2.png"></p>
<p>For view and sun direction in opposite directions <code>(x_tx>0 (VAA<sup>*</sup>>180°)</code>, <code>SAA<sup>*</sup><180°</code>
    or
    <code>x_tx<0 (VAA<sup>*</sup><180°)</code>, <code>SAA<sup>*</sup>>180°</code>, angles corrected for orientation)
    follows accordingly:</p>
<p><img src="images/eq002_apparentSza_3.png"></p>

<p>The sun azimuth angles are corrected by the orientation (North direction) at the current cloud pixel, so that they
    represent the azimuth angle in the projected grid coordinates with 0° in upwards direction on the grid. The view
    azimuth angle is replaced by the tie point grid x_tx, which gives the distance from the nadir line at the center
    position of a pixel. It changes its sign from left of nadir x_tx <0 to right of nadir x_tx>0. This is the easiest
    way to find the viewing direction (without interpolation and corrections), and it allows the algorithm to process
    subsets of the swath width.</p>

<h4>Determining the search path in illumination direction</h4>
<p>Starting from a cloud pixel, which is defined by the cloud flag expression, the illumination path is projected on the
    grid and all pixels up to a maximum distance are identified which are intersected by this path.</p>
<p>With the adjusted sun zenith angle &theta;<sup>*</sup><sub>S</sub> and the azimuth angles adjusted for North
    direction, so that they represent
    the azimuth on the grid against the Y-direction, the geometry of the illumination path on the projection grid can be
    fully described.</p>
<p>Orientation (North direction) at pixel [i, j] is calculated by the positions at neighboring pixels<br>
    <code>p[i, j-1] = (lon1, lat1) and p[i, j+1]= (lon2, lat2)</code>. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/eq003_searchPath_1.png"></p>
<p>The theoretical maximum length of the projected path in grid coordinates is defined by the range of surface elevation
    and the adjusted angles in x and y direction (spatial resolution 1km in AATSR products):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/eq003_searchPath_2.png"></p>
<p>The relative grid coordinates of the start point at the cloud pixel at set to <code>(x0, y0) = (0, 0)</code>.</p>
<p>As the spatial resolution of the grid is quite coarse with regard to the expected cloud top heights, which are
    currently fixed at 6km, the maximum extent of the search path is defined as </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/eq003_searchPath_3.png"></p>
<p>With <code>sign(x)</code> defined as: for <code>x>=0, sign(x)=1; for x<0, sign(x)=-1</code>.<br>
    For all integer value combinations between <code>(x0,y0)</code> and <code>(x1,y1)</code>, the center position of the
    pixel is set to relative grid coordinates <code>+ (0.5, 0.5)</code>. The distance from each pixel center to the
    theoretical line of illumination is calculated. If the distance is smaller than <code>0.5*&radic;2</code>, the pixel
    area is intersected by the line, and the pixel is potentially a shadow pixel.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/eq003_searchPath_4.png"></p>
<p>For the intersected pixels (distance < <code>0.5*&radic;2</code>, relative grid coordinates x, y) the theoretical
    height of the illumination path is calculated as:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/eq003_searchPath_5.png"></p>
<p>Where the theoretical line intersects the surface defined by its altitude, the shadow can be found. The discreet
    nature of the grid calls for a height threshold, so that shadow pixels can be identified:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/eq003_searchPath_6.png"></p>
<p>The cloud shadow flag is raised for all the pixels of the path, which are not masked as cloud and the theoretical
    height intersects with the surface elevation:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/eq003_searchPath_7.png"></p>

<h3>Algorithmic Limitations</h3>
<h4>Cloud Top Height</h4>
<p>The AATSR Level-1 product does not provide clooud top height information. Therefor this values is predefined to a
    value of 6000 meter. The processor interface allows to adjust this value for each processed scene.</p>

<h4>Limited to Daytime</h4>
<p>The cloud shadow calculation is limited to the daytime. As daytime is the part of the orgbit considered where SZA<85°
    and the confidence_in flag day (bit value 10) is raised.</p>
