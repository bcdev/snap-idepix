<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The nadir product of AATSR 4th reprocessing is missing a flag indicating cloud shadows. The IdePix AATSR Cloud Shadow
    processor aims to provide such a flag over land.
    It has been the goal to calculate this cloud shadow flag based on the information in the Level 1 product only. From the
    cloud flag and the geometry of sun illumination and observation almost all necessary information is given, which
    allows a translation of the cloud shadow algorithm for OLCI to AATSR.
    The general idea is to start from a pixel, which has been flagged as a cloud, and follow the direction of
    illumination until the surface is reached.
<!--TODO-->    <!--ALMOST? Mention CTH here?-->
    This Idepix processor does not provide all flags which are defined by other IdePix processors. This one sets only 3 of the general IdePix flags.<br>
    These are:<br>
    <b>IDEPIX_CLOUD, IDEPIX_CLOUD_SHADOW and IDEPIX_LAND</b>
